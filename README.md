# Welcome

This is my first independent project as a up and coming full stack developer, Studying towards my Diploma with Code Institute. This project has been produced using html and css.

This website has been created for a content creator Aliica, who produces content for multible platforms. The main goal is to collect all the channels together to be easily found when the consumer is looking for it. The request from the cutomer is to create more detailed and personal version of the popular linktr.ee website used by many content creators.

The website bring together all the information about this creator and more can be easily added if the portfolio grows.
